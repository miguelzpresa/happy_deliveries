A parallelized  version of tabu search metaheuristic to find global optimal routes for the Traveling Salesman Problem

---

____
# Project Overview :microscope:
The parallelized Tabu Search can effectively manage the exploration and exploitation phases concurrently, ensuring a more comprehensive search of the solution space.

Moreover, the proposed method enhances the capability to escape local optima through diversification strategies, thereby increasing the likelihood of identifying the global optimum. The parallelization also enables scalability, making it suitable for large-scale instances of the TSP.



# Justification :telescope:
---
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known NP-complete problem that poses significant computational challenges due to its combinatorial nature. Traditional optimization techniques often fall short when dealing with the immense solution space, making it imperative to explore advanced metaheuristics.

# Objectives of each_Phase :pushpin:
---
##### Phase 1: 
* Design,experimentation and  implementation of Tabu Search algorithm with different parallelization styles
##### Phase 2:
* Use the program to calculate the optimal route given a map of M√©xico with
  its respective delivery points and fulfillment centers,apply the algorithm
  in order to showcase the power of Paralellization & Metaheuristics
##### Phase 3:
* Visual UI dev
##### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
Integrate all the previous phases into a functional and efficient system.
Conduct exhaustive testing to ensure that the system works correctly in all situations.
